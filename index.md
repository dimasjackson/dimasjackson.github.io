## About Me

Hello there! As a Data Engineer at @Mackenzie and a PhD student at SÃ£o Paulo State University, I specialize in leveraging cutting-edge technologies to drive innovative solutions in data processing, management and storage! Developing ETL robust pipelines, improve large data load performance and enhance data governance and quality are some of my abilities. Check out some projects I participate:

## Projects

### Enterprise Service Bus Functions and Procedures

This project is an ecosystem of procedures and functions in PL/SQL for processing non-relational data coming from APIs and storing it in the relational database, combining the best features of both paradigms. This project allowed the company data to be processed and updated much faster and with better reliability. The functions and procedures increased the performance by up to 400% across data loads and reduced the cost to consult data. Improoving the processing and storage we achieved better data quality, allowing more confident data driven decisions.
