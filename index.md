## About Me
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
Hello there! As a Data Engineer at @Mackenzie and a PhD student at SÃ£o Paulo State University, I specialize in leveraging cutting-edge technologies to drive innovative solutions in data processing, management and storage! Developing ETL robust pipelines, improve large data load performance and enhance data governance and quality are some of my abilities. Check out some projects I participate:

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
This project is an ecosystem of procedures and functions in PL/SQL for processing non-relational data coming from APIs and storing it in the relational database, combining the best features of both paradigms. This project allowed the company data to be processed and updated much faster and with better reliability. The functions and procedures increased the performance by up to 400% across data loads and reduced the cost to get data. Improoving the processing and storage we achieved better data quality, allowing more confident data driven decisions.

I design and build several ETL workflows, extracting data from different sources like CRM systems APIs, SQL databases and the Enterprise Data Warehouse. The extracted data was cleaned, normalized and loaded into a secure workspace for analytics and BI development. This strategy improved the efficiency in delivering high quality data trough different sectors of the company and increased the confiedence of the analysis that have been carried out. Also, I contributed to the standard polices of the organization in data delivering, elevating the level of Data Governance and Compliance.
