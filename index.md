Hello there! As a Data Engineer at @Mackenzie and a PhD student at São Paulo State University, I specialize in leveraging cutting-edge technologies to drive innovative solutions in data processing, management and storage! Developing robust ETL pipelines, improving data load performance and the strategic application of Large Language Models, such as Chat GPT, within the business realm, are some of my abilities. Check out some projects I worked!

**Situation:** With the implemententation of the new ERP, the company identified the necessity for integration of hundreds of legacy system and the construction of a Enterprise Service Bus - ESB, to remove data silos. 

**Task:** The data coming from ESB APIs had to be processed and storage with efficiency, being transformed from JSON documents into a structured database, to allow retrieval and  near real time update.

**Action:** Our team designed and built an ecosystem of procedures and functions in PL/SQL for processing non-relational data coming from APIs and storing it in the relational database in AWS, combining the best features of both paradigms.

**Result:** This project allowed the company data to be processed and updated much faster and with better reliability. The functions and procedures increased the performance by up to 400% across data loads and reduced the cost to retrieve data. Improving the processing and storage we achieved faster data delivery for analytics and BI. Also, a better data quality was reached, since the data was standardized and integrated, allowing more confident data driven decisions.

**Situation:**  The need arises to enhance user interaction by enabling natural language questions and answers within the Wikibase platform. This will facilitate a more user-friendly and intuitive experience for accessing information stored in the Enterprise Knowledge Graph.

**Task:** Create a Wikibase LangChain agent, an intelligent natural language processing system, that can understand and respond to user queries in a conversational manner. The goal is to improve the accessibility of information stored in the private Wikibase instance, making it easier for users to retrieve relevant data through natural language interactions.

**Action:** I conducted a thorough analysis of existing natural language processing (NLP) technologies and solutions and evaluate potential tools and frameworks suitable for integrating NLP capabilities into the Wikibase environment. Now I am implementing the necessary NLP components using state-of-the-art algorithms and models, and integrating the LangChain agent with the private Wikibase instance, ensuring compatibility and security measures are in place.
  
**Result:** The Wikibase LangChain agent have been deployed in the private Wikibase instance, enabling users to interact with the system using natural language queries. This will result in a more user-friendly and accessible environment, enhancing the overall user experience within the organization. The stakeholders will be able to ask questions in a conversational manner and receive relevant information from the Wikibase instance, fostering increased efficiency and engagement with the data stored in the Knowledge Graph without the necessity of learning SPARQL language or call analysts to answer simple business questions.

**Situation:** The company’s teams need data of better quality and compliance, delivered quickly and in a secure environment for analysis.

**Task:** We had to integrate different data sources into pipelines capable of cleaning, anonymizing, and loading data to third-party platforms.

**Action:** I designed and built several ETL pipelines, extracting data from various sources such as CRM system APIs, SQL databases, and the Enterprise Data Warehouse. I combined different SQL tools, including Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and MySQL, with the versatile and low-code Knime Analytics Platform. The extracted data was cleaned, normalized, and loaded into a secure workspace for analytics and BI development within a Microsoft Power BI Workspace.

**Result:** This strategy significantly improved the efficiency of delivering high-quality data to different teams within the company. It also boosted confidence in the analyses conducted. Additionally, I contributed to standardizing the organization’s data delivery policies, thereby enhancing Data Governance and Compliance.
