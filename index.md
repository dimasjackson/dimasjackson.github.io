Hello there! As a Data Engineer at @Mackenzie and a PhD student at SÃ£o Paulo State University, I specialize in leveraging cutting-edge technologies to drive innovative solutions in data processing, management and storage! Developing robust ETL pipelines, improving data load performance and the strategic application of Large Language Models, such as Chat GPT, within the business realm, are some of my abilities. Check out some projects I worked!

**Situation:** With the implemententation of the new ERP, the company identified the necessity for integration of hundreds of legacy system and the construction of a Enterprise Service Bus - ESB, to remove data silos. 

**Task:** The data coming from ESB APIs had to be processed and storage with efficiency, being transformed from JSON documents into a structured database, to allow retrieval and  near real time update.

**Action:** Our team designed and built an ecosystem of procedures and functions in PL/SQL for processing non-relational data coming from APIs and storing it in the relational database in AWS, combining the best features of both paradigms.

**Result:** This project allowed the company data to be processed and updated much faster and with better reliability. The functions and procedures increased the performance by up to 400% across data loads and reduced the cost to retrieve data. Improving the processing and storage we achieved faster data delivery for analytics and BI. Also, a better data quality was reached, since the data was standardized and integrated, allowing more confident data driven decisions.

**Situation:** Other company teams needs data with better quality and compliance, delivered fast and in a secure environment to be analised.

**Task:** Different data sources had to be integrated into pipelines which should be able to clean, anonimyze and load data to third part platfoms.  

**Action:** I design and build several ETL workflows, extracting data from different sources like CRM systems APIs, SQL databases and the Enterprise Data Warehouse. I combined different SQL tools such as Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL and MySQL with the versatile and low code Knime Analytics tool. The extracted data was cleaned, normalized and loaded into a secure workspace for analytics and BI development, into a Microsoft Power BI Workspace.
  
**Result:** This strategy improved the efficiency in delivering high quality data for different teams of the company and increased the confiedence of the analysis that have been carried out. Also, I contributed to the standard polices of the organization in data delivering, elevating the level of Data Governance and Compliance.
