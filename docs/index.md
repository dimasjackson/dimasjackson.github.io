## About Me

I'm a Generative AI specialist architect at one of the world's largest banks, Spanish Santander!

I designed an application to find and correct, through an AI agent, codes that process Brazilian company IDs (CNPJ), to accept the new alphanumeric CNPJ standard, reducing correction costs and time. I architected a Voice Recognition solution using AI, collaborating with a global team, and participated in proofs of concept and pilot implementations of Generative AI, using services such as MCP, A2A, Amazon Q, Amazon Bedrock, Microsoft Copilot for Power BI, and Databricks.

Previously, I worked on improving data quality/governance at one of Brazil's largest private universities, Mackenzie.

I hold a PhD degree from S√£o Paulo State University (UNESP).
