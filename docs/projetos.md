**Situation:** The new alphanumeric CNPJ (Brazilian Company ID) standard required adaptations in various systems that process CNPJ, making obsolete the codes that only validate the traditional numeric format.

**Action:** I designed an application based on a generative AI agent, capable of locating code snippets that process CNPJ and suggesting automatic corrections to accept the new alphanumeric standard.

**Result:** The solution accelerated system adaptation, reducing errors and rework, and ensured compliance with the new CNPJ standard in an automated and efficient way.
