**Situation:** This project is a predictive analysis of the Space X Falcon 9 success landing rate for IBM Data Science Certification final capstone.

**Task:** Data collection from Space X database and web, descriptive data analysis, predictive analysis with Machine Learning.

**Action:** I collected, processed and analyzed data and built, validated and compared Machine Learning models to understand the most relevant variables related to
the improving of success rate. To do that, I perform data wrangling including missing values treatment and class labeling. Furthermore, I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualization
and SQL and built interactive visual analytics using Folium & Plotly Dash. Finaly, I developed a predictive analysis using classification models and hyperparameter tuning for SVM, Classification Trees and Logistic Regression.

**Result:** The launch site KS LC-39A, payload mass between 2500-5000 kg and orbit type SSO have highest success rate. We can predict if a launch will be successful or fail with 87% accuracy in
test data. See the full [repository code and reports](https://github.com/dimasjackson/Space-X-landing-success-analysis/tree/main).
