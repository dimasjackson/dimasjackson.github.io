**Situation:** In this project, data from the 2021 school census, was analyzed to identify and obtain information about the profile of evangelical denominational schools in Brazil for the [Association of Christian Schools International ACSI](https://www.acsi.org/).

**Task:** The task was to analyze the data and identify the quantity and profile of evangelical schools in Brazil, including their size, location, infrastructure, and ownership.

**Action:** Through a keyword search for terms related to this segment, 1905 evangelical schools were identified, and their data was analyzed to draw conclusions about the profile of these schools. A data extraction, cleaning and transformation was made and descriptive statistc was conducted to reveal insights about the denominational schools. Finally, a interactive Power BI dashboard was created to allow stakeholders search and obatain information on demand about the brazilian evangelical educaton.

**Result:** The analysis revealed that Brazilian evangelical schools are mostly small or medium-sized schools, concentrated in urban areas, and offering early childhood education. 
Most of these schools are maintained by private companies or non-profit institutions, but there is also a small number maintained by NGOs, OSCIPs, and labor unions. 
Over half of the schools use the internet in the teaching and learning process, and most do not have nutritionists, speech therapists, social workers, and psychologists. 
The project recommends that ACSI develop materials and services aimed at the profile of schools described above, and projects be designed to raise awareness about the importance of Christian education in the final years of primary, secondary, and technical education. As a result, we provided to ACSI a report with the complete description of the schools and a interactive dashboard for future queries with 2022 updated data.

# Estimation of the Fraction of Matter and Energy of the Universe

**Situation:** What is the fractional amount of matter and energy of the universe? This project aim was to answer that question, comparing mathematical models and a Machine Learning algorithm to observational mesuares. 

**Task:** Analyse luminosity distance data to estimate the cosmological parameters using statiscs and advanced algorithms.

**Action:** I collected supernova data from an international collaboration survey, built from scratch a non-naive bayes regression algorithm to fit the luminosity distance curve and used Bayesian inference to find the probabilities of the parameters values, given the data collected. Then, I used the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to estimate the final values and respective uncertainties.

**Result:** The fractions of matter and radiation that I estimated are in agreement with the Planck Satellite 2018 release. These parameters was computed considering 10000 Markov Chains generated by 2000 walkers using the emcee implementation of the Monte Carlo algorithm. Since about 40 steps are needed for the chain to "forget" where it started we discarded the initial 100 steps. The final estimation choosen was the 50-th percentile of the flatted samples and the uncertainty the diference of the central value with the 25-th and the 75-th percentiles respectively. The final values encountered are matter density 

$\Omega_m = 0.333^{+0.066}_{−0.068}$

the dark energy density 

$\Omega_\Lambda = 0.711^{+0.071}_{−0.066}$

and the Hubble parameter 

$H_0 = 68.712^{+6.552}_{−6.497}{\rm km/s/Mpc}$

which agree with the direct observation of these parameters released by th Planck Satelite collaboration (2018): $H_0 = (67.4\pm0.5){\rm km/s/Mpc};  \Omega_m=0.315\pm0.007$ and $\Omega_\Lambda = 1 - \Omega_m$.

**Situation:** This project is a predictive analysis of the Space X Falcon 9 success landing rate for IBM Data Science Certification final capstone.

**Task:** Data collection from Space X database and web, descriptive data analysis, predictive analysis with Machine Learning.

**Action:** I collected, processed and analyzed data and built, validated and compared Machine Learning models to understand the most relevant variables related to
the improving of success rate. To do that, I perform data wrangling including missing values treatment and class labeling. Furthermore, I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualization
and SQL and built interactive visual analytics using Folium & Plotly Dash. Finaly, I developed a predictive analysis using classification models and hyperparameter tuning for SVM, Classification Trees and Logistic Regression.

**Result:** The launch site KS LC-39A, payload mass between 2500-5000 kg and orbit type SSO have highest success rate. We can predict if a launch will be successful or fail with 87% accuracy in
test data. See the full [repository code and reports](https://github.com/dimasjackson/Space-X-landing-success-analysis/tree/main).
