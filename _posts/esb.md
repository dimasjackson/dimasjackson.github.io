## Description
This project is an ecosystem of procedures and functions in PL/SQL for processing non-relational data coming from APIs and storing it in the relational database, combining the best features of both paradigms. We developed an interface to communicate with Enterprise Service Bus - ESB, which provides data from multiple origins like backoffice, human resource and accountability. The data comes from an Enterprise Resource Planning - ERP system, being processed in the ESB as a non-relational (JSON) message. After that, it will be converted into a structured form in AWS Relational Database System - RDS, serverless cloud environment. Finally, the data may be accesed both in structured and unstructured forms, retrieving the better carachteristics of the two paradigms. 

## Achievements
This project allowed the company data to be processed and updated much faster and with better reliability. The functions and procedures built to enhance data processing and storage, increased the performance by up to 400% across data loads. Improoving the time of processing we achieved better data quality, allowing more confident data driven decisions.
